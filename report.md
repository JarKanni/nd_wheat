# North Dakota Wheat Production 1990-2024


$\hspace{15pt}$ Where wheat once stood strong, beautiful yellow flowers of canola now spread across the landscape of North Dakota.
North Dakota's plummeting wheat production since 1990[1] has made way for Canola to thrive.  
From 11.3 million acres in 1990, peaking in 1996 with 12.5 million before heading down to 6.5 million by 2023[1]

A blight of scab, or Fusarium Head Blight Disease (FHB), sprang up in the early 1990s and again in the early 2000s, wiping out hundreds of thousands of acres across the state.[2]
To escape disease and find better opportunities, many farmers have turned to canola which is high on price with growing yields.[3]  

In 2022, North Dakota hit a record high canola production, peaking at 3.42 billion pounds.[4]
Today in 2024, canola holds 4th most produced crop in the state, beaten only by wheat, soybeans, and corn, repectively.[5]
Corn production rose since 1990 from around 2.6 million acres harvested to a peak of 3.5 million acres in 2007 before leveling off around 3.3 million.[6]
Although more corn is produced since than the 90's, production growth has leveled off for a decade.

## Questions
#### How has wheat production changed since 1990, and why?
- Wheat production lowered since the 1990s due to disease and oppurtunites elsewhere (canola prices)
			- [source 1](https://www.ndwheat.com/uploads/1/ndallhistwhtacres.pdf)
	- Disease wrecked production, cutting it from around 3,000,000 acres down to roughly 1,000,000 acres planted
		- FHB or scab: Fusarium Head Blight Disease
			- [source 2](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PDIS-03-12-0291-FE)

- Canola production on the rise
 	- poor soybean prices, so farmers move to canola

    	- 2022 record canola production, North Dakota leading the way
        	- ND (3.42 billion pounds), second place Washington (231.4 million pounds)
