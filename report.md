# North Dakota Wheat Production 1990-2024

## Questions
#### How has wheat production changed since 1990, and why?
- Wheat production lowered since the 1990s due to disease and oppurtunites elsewhere (canola prices)
	- Disease wrecked production, cutting it from around 3,000,000 acres down to roughly 1,000,000 acres planted
		- FHB or scab: Fusarium Head Blight Disease

- Canola production on the rise
 	- poor soybean prices, so farmers move to canola
