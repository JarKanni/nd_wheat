# North Dakota Wheat Production 1990-2024

Purpose: To quell a personal curiosity.  
Line of Thought: Growing up in North Dakota, wheat fields were everywhere.  Now when I go, I see more and more canola or corn.  Why did that change, and by how much? 

### Questions
1. How has wheat production changed since 1990, and why?

2. Which crops are mostly grown in North Dakota / Mountrail County today?
